### Hey there, I'm Labinot 😁 
I'm currently 24 years old and live in the middle of Germany. I started to seriously learn programming in 2022, before that I was (and still am) a IT-Security / Sys. Administrator. I'm interested in my lifelong passion of gaming, as well as cultures around the world. I'm currently learning IaC mainly, and have been programming on the side.
