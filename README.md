### Hey there, I'm Labinot :) (yes, that's a real name..)
I'm currently 23 years old and live in the middle of Germany. I started to seriously learn programming in 2022, before that I was (and still am) a IT-Security / Sys. Administrator. I'm interested in my lifelong passion of gaming, as well as cultures around the world. I'm currently learning Web-Development with the Odin Project and try to bring my programming skills up to speed to get into it professionally.
